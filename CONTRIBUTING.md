# Contributing to Nova Expo Template

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature-name`.

## Code Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style.
- Follow the template's feature-based component structure (paths relative to `template/`): generic UI goes in `components/shared/` (`ui`, `layout`, `wrappers`, `vendor`), feature-scoped components and screens go in `components/features/<feature>/`, and code outside a feature imports it only through that feature's `index.ts` barrel. See [Component Architecture](template/README.md#-component-architecture) in the template README.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

## Submitting Changes
1. Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin feature-name`.
2. Open a pull request against the `main` branch.
3. Provide a clear description of your changes and link any related issues.

## Reporting Issues
If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue with detailed information.

Thank you for contributing!
